- Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome. 
- For example, "abcdcba" should return true, since it can be reversed and still spell "abcdcba", "abcdefg" should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome. 

Hint : In order to be a palindrome, the word, phrase, or sequence has to read the same backward as it does forward
